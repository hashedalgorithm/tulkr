Tulkr Privacy Policy (GDPR / EU)

Effective date: [01-02-2026]
Controller: [SanjayKumar Kumaravelan]

1. Overview
   Tulkr is a browser extension that allows users to upload subtitle files (e.g., .srt) and display them as an on-screen subtitle overlay synchronized to videos in a selected browser tab. Tulkr is designed to operate locally on your device.

Tulkr does not sell personal data and does not use your data for advertising.

2. What data Tulkr processes
   Tulkr may process the following categories of data, depending on how you use the extension:

A) User-provided subtitle data

- Subtitle file content (e.g., .srt text) that you upload.
- Subtitle file metadata such as filename and size.

B) Session data (to attach subtitles to a tab)

- Tab identifiers (e.g., tabId) needed to associate subtitles with a specific tab during a browsing session.
- Tab metadata you select/see in the UI such as tab title, tab URL, and favicon URL, to help you identify the correct tab/session.

C) Configuration settings (appearance and playback)

- Subtitle appearance settings: font size, text color, background color, stroke color, stroke weight, position settings (if enabled).
- Per-session timing settings such as subtitle delay/offset.

3. Sources of data

- Directly from you when you upload subtitle files and change settings.
- From the browser extension APIs when you choose a tab or manage sessions.

4. Purpose of processing
   Tulkr processes the above data solely to:

- Create and manage subtitle sessions per selected tab
- Render subtitles over video playback in the selected tab
- Apply your chosen subtitle appearance settings
- Apply per-session delay/offset to synchronize subtitles
- Restore your sessions/settings after reload (where applicable)

5. Legal basis (GDPR)
   Tulkr processes personal data (to the extent tab metadata may be considered personal data) under the following legal bases:

- Performance of a contract / service you request (Art. 6(1)(b)):
  Processing required to provide the extension’s core functionality (displaying subtitles in the selected tab).

- Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f)), where applicable:
  Minimal processing necessary to operate the extension reliably and maintain your settings locally.
  Your interests and rights are respected because data stays on-device and is not used for profiling or marketing.

Where consent is required by law for any optional feature (e.g., analytics), Tulkr will request consent before enabling it. (Note: Tulkr currently does not perform analytics by default.)

6. Where data is stored
   Tulkr stores data locally in your browser:

- Browser extension storage (e.g., chrome.storage) for configuration settings.
- Extension-local IndexedDB for session records and uploaded subtitle text (when session persistence is enabled).

Tulkr does not upload subtitle content or settings to external servers.

7. Data sharing and international transfers
   Tulkr does not share your data with third parties and does not transfer your data outside the EU/EEA because it does not transmit your data to external servers.

8. Data retention

- Settings are retained locally until you change them or remove the extension data.
- Session records and subtitle text are retained locally until you delete sessions in the extension UI and/or remove the extension, or clear extension data via browser settings.

You control retention by deleting sessions and/or uninstalling the extension.

9. Security
   Tulkr is designed to minimize data exposure:

- Data is stored locally on your device.
- Tulkr does not transmit subtitle content or session data over the network.
- Tulkr uses browser extension isolation mechanisms (extension origin storage) for stored data.

No method of storage is 100% secure. You should avoid uploading sensitive personal data in subtitle files.

10. Your rights (GDPR)
    If Tulkr processes personal data about you, you may have the following rights under GDPR, depending on circumstances:

- Right of access
- Right to rectification
- Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”)
- Right to restriction of processing
- Right to data portability
- Right to object
- Right to withdraw consent (where processing is based on consent)

How to exercise rights:
Because Tulkr stores data locally and does not maintain user accounts or collect data on a server, most requests can be satisfied directly by you:

- To access or export data: view sessions/settings in the extension UI (where available) or inspect local extension storage.
- To delete data: delete sessions in the UI and/or uninstall the extension (or clear extension data in browser settings).

If you need assistance, contact: [your email address].

11. Children
    Tulkr is not directed to children. The extension does not knowingly collect personal data from children. Since Tulkr does not operate a backend service, it does not maintain profiles or accounts.

12. Permissions explanation (transparency)
    Tulkr may request certain browser permissions to function. For example:

- tabs: to list tabs so you can choose where to attach subtitles.
- host permissions: to run the content script on sites where you want subtitles displayed.
- storage: to store your settings and session data locally.

These permissions are used only to provide the extension’s core subtitle overlay functionality.

13. Changes to this policy
    If Tulkr’s functionality changes in a way that affects data processing, this Privacy Policy may be updated. The effective date at the top will reflect the latest version.
